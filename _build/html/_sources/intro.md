# Quantitative Finance Book
## Welcome to my problem book

### Acknowledgement

- Special credit goes to Dr. Fang Fang (TU Delft) for her foundational contributions to computational finance and the COS method in particular. The implementation and analysis of Fourier-based pricing methods in this work builds upon the research of Fang & Oosterlee (2009, 2010) and coursework under Dr. Fang's guidance. 



- Goal of this book is to summarise key topics encountered, analyse them deeper and extend them further.
- Emphasis will be put on developing intuition and decomposing these often tricky topics in simple words.
